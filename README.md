# triplea
fork of svn-sourceforge project "TripleA" -- A board game simulator

see [the original's home page](http://triplea.sourceforge.net/mywiki) for more information.

This fork / clone exists to provide an easy, git-based version for me to tinker with. Additionally, I can also drop
support for everything less than java 8, use my own coding style, and make arbitrarily large changes or focus mostly
on modes that I personally care about. It is not intended to replace the original in any capacity (except for maybe a
few friends).
